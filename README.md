# Azure Fundamentals 
## VMs
* In Azure, you are charged for the VM per second
* In Windows, you have an Administrator username and password where as in Linux, you have SSH keys to access the instance
* You need to pay for the Windows  License by default, but can use yours if you already have one
* You can "resize" VMs to a bigger/smaller instance in Azure  
### Features
* Auto Shutdown option available

## Scaling
* There is a limit to vertical scaling in Azure 
* 96 vCPUs and 384 GB Memory is the upper limit for General Purpose Instances
* Vertical Scaling does not improve availability (since you're upgrading a one single instance) 
* There is no limit to horizontal scaling

## PaaS
* Azure App Services is a PaaS 
* Includes autoscaling features, CI/CD, containers, staging and dev environments, etc ...

## Regions
* Usually, there is only one region per country, but in Azure, some countries have multiple regions

### Region Pair
* In Azure, you have something called a region pair, where two regions are paired. And these paired regions have highest speed connections and special treatment during Azure updates

### Sovereign Regions
* Sovereign Regions are special clouds not available to the public but associated with the Government. You need special permissions/approval to connect to those cloud regions

## Availability Zones
* Not every region in Azure support AZs
* There are 3 types of services in Azure:
    * **Zonal**: You deploy services to a speicific AZ and duplicate it to other AZs for backup and availability
    * **Zone-Redundant**: Azure automatically deploys across multiple AZs in the region
    * **Always Available**: Services deployed globally across multiple regions 

## Resource, Resource Groups and Subscriptions

### Resource Groups
* Resources can be grouped with Resource Groups. RGs are associated with a region but it can contain resources from different regions.
* Each Resource **must** belong to **only one** resource group
* Permissions can be assigned at the resource group level
### Subscriptions
* Subscription is a billing unit in Azure
* There is a payment method associated with each subscription
* Subscription Plans include Free Plan, Pay-As-You-Go, Enterprise Agreement ....
* Subscriptions are usually used to seperate out diff depts in a business, Ex: Finance, IT, Sales.... OR seperate by Geography NA, Europe, Asia

### Management Groups
* Management Groups are used to group multiple subscriptions

## VM Scale Sets
* Multiple Virtual Machines running the same code
* Supports Autoscaling
* Can handle upto 100 VMs in a single scale set. Can configure it upto a 1000 VMs
* VM Scale set is free but you do pay for the underlying instances 

### Azure Virtual Desktop  
* Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop version of Windows that runs in the cloud. You can log into it from anywhere 

## Networking Services
* **ExpressRoute** - A high speed private connection to Azure
* Peering Virtual Networks allows instances in one VM to communicate with instances in other VM. This can be global as well
* You have an option of creating a public/private endpoint on a resource that is created.   

## Storage Services
### Azure Storage
* In Azure, you create a Storage account and in that account you have 4 different types of storages:
    * Containers or Blobs (Similar to object storage in S3)
    * File Shares
    * Queues
    * Tables
* You have `Standard` and `Premium` performance types in Azure Storage. Premium Performance = Low Latency
* A storage account supports max of 5 PBs 
* In Azure storage you pay per GB whereas in Disk Storage, you pay for the full capacity (ex: 8GB Hard Disk)
```
Azure Storage => Unmanaged
Disk Storage => Managed
```

### Other Storage Services
* Azure **Storage Explorer** is a software that can be run on your local machine to upload files to storage. It is getting depreciated soon and is replaced with **Storage browser** instead which performs the similar functionality as well 
* **AZcopy** is a CLI tool that allows you to copy files across blob containers (Storage) in Azure. You can also use it to download files locally or even transfer to a storage bucket on another cloud
* Azure **File Sync** enables to sync on premises file server in the cloud
* Azure **Migrate** is a service that allows you to easily migrate to the cloud. It scans for VMs, databases, services in your environments (on-premises) and plans for your migration
* **DataBox** is a physical device that you can request for to transfer data to Azure offline 

## Identity Services
* Azure Active Directory (AAD) is an Identity as a Service provided by Azure. It is not the same as the traditional Active Directory that runs on Windows
* Developers can use AAD to implement authentication for their end users
* There is an option called Conditional access in AAD which allows to set up MFA and other restrictions on detecting unusual login 


### Zero Trust Security Model
* Just In Time (JIT) Model: You request for permissions only when you need it
* Just-Enough-Access (JEA): Least previlege principle 

### Role Based Control Access
* Roles in Azure are similar to GCP. They are permissions binded to users

> Policies are attached to resources whereas roles are attached to users

## Pricing Calculator
* Azure has a Total Cost Of Ownership (TCO) calculator that include the price of electiricty, cooling, maintenance and so on ...
* This can be used to compare your on-premises(TCO) cost with the cloud
## Security and Governance
Tools used for security and Governance:
### Azure Policy
* You can enforce a policy on resources created. 
* You can have all VMs have a backup on a regular basis
### Azure BluePrint
* You can create Blueprints and attach it to a subscription. The blueprint is created when the subscription is active. The blueprint maybe like have 5 VM instances with one Load balancer

### Resource Locks
* **Read only** locks and **cannot delete** locks on resources can be used

### Service Trust Portal
* Centralized repository for all the compliance artefacts by Azure

### Microsoft Defender
* Microsoft Defender is a paid service provided by Azure for security protection of cloud services 

## Azure Arc
* Azure Arc is a service that allows you to manage resources running on on-premises and multi-cloud. It is basically a unified view of all the resources that you are using

## Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
* Azure Resource Manager is what you interact with behind the hood when creating resources in the Console or CLI, powershell or anything ...
![](img/arm.png)

* You can create ARM templates and deploy those ARM templates to create Resources (more like Infrastrcture as a Code)

## Other Services
### Azure Advisor
* Analyzes all your resources and provides recommendations that you can do to save costs, minimize vulnerabilities and so on ...

### Azure Service Health
* Used to alert overall health and wellbeing of Azure Datacenters, Regions if you're resources are present in any one of those regions

### Azure Monitor
* Allows you to monitor all Azure Resources in one place
* **Diagnostic settings** in many Azure resources allows you to collect, export, query and view logs in Azure Monitor  
* **Workbooks** in Azure Monitor allows you to create and manage a visual reports of your own metrics
