# Azure Fundamentals 
## VMs
* In Azure, you are charged for the VM per minute
* In Windows, you have an Administrator username and password where as in Linux, you have SSH keys to access the instance
* You need to pay for the Windows  License by default, but can use yours if you already have one 
### Features
* Auto Shutdown option available

## Scaling
* There is a limit to vertical scaling in Azure 
* 96 vCPUs and 384 GB Memory is the upper limit for General Purpose Instances
* Vertical Scaling does ont improve availability (since you're upgrading a one single instance) 
* There is no limit to horizontal scaling
